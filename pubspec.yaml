  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:

  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - res/images/weight_background.jpg
    - res/images/wxr.png

  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
